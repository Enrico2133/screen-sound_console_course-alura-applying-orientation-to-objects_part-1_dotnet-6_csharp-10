## üìö About the Course

This course focuses on the essential aspects of C# and Object-Oriented Programming. You will learn how to create classes, encapsulate data using properties, and integrate objects effectively. The course also covers constructors and provides practical challenges to reinforce your learning.

## üîë Key Concepts

### Classes

Classes are the building blocks of object-oriented programming. They allow you to create custom data types that model real-world entities. In this repository, you will find examples demonstrating how to define and use classes effectively.

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of OOP. It restricts access to certain components of an object and only exposes necessary parts. This helps maintain the integrity of the data. In our exercises, you will see how to implement encapsulation using properties.

### Constructors

Constructors are special methods used to initialize objects. They allow you to set up initial values for object attributes. This repository includes exercises that show how to create and use constructors in C#.

### Integration Between Objects

Objects often need to work together. This section covers how to integrate multiple objects, allowing them to communicate and collaborate. You will find practical examples that illustrate this concept.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get started with this repository, you will need to have .NET 6 and C# 10 installed on your machine. You can follow the official documentation for installation instructions.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 6 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/6.0)
